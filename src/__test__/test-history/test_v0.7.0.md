  static measureMemoryUsage(): number;
  static forceGarbageCollection(): void;
}
```

2. **Centralized Configuration**

```typescript
const TEST_CONFIG = {
  QUICK_TIMEOUT: 5000,
  INTEGRATION_TIMEOUT: 10000,
  PERFORMANCE_TIMEOUT: 30000,
  PERFORMANCE_LIMITS: {
    /* configurable limits */
  },
};
```

3. **Performance Measurement Integration**

```typescript
const { result, duration } = await measureTime(() =>
  TestUtilities.simulateBracketParsing(content)
);
```
