# Bracket Lynx

Enhances the development experience by displaying a label next to each closing parenthesis, indicating the name of the corresponding block or function, along with the start and end line numbers.

Bracket Lynx is a VS Code extension that provides intelligent bracket decorations for 11 programming languages and frameworks, helping developers quickly understand code structure and scope. It uses optimized parsing, smart filtering, and multi-level caching for high performance and accuracy. Granular control and color customization are available through the command palette.
